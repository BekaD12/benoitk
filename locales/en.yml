  description: I am currently seeking a Fullstack developer position with a primary focus on Frontend development, which is the aspect of the job that I excel in and enjoy the most. As I embarked on my journey as a web developer, it became evident to me that I was drawn to bridging the gap between design and development. Give me a web mockup and I'll come out with a great frontend, I code a lot of custom CSS and I love it. I currently use Vue.js (Vite) and Shopify (liquid) on personal and freelance projects, it would be a good opportunity to be able to use these technologies in future mission.
