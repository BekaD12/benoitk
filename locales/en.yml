  description: I am currently looking for a Fullstack developer position with a Frontend predominance which is the branch of my job that I master and appreciate the most. When I started my career as a web developer, I noticed quickly that I was interested into being the glue between design and development. Give me a web mockup and I'll come out with a great frontend, I code a lot of custom CSS and I love it. I currently use Vue.js, Typescript and Shopify (liquid) on personal and freelance projects, it would be a good opportunity to be able to use these technologies in a professional environment.
