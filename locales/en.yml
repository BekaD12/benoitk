  description: I'm a traditional frontend developer since 2010, won some website awards in 2011/2012, and since then worked for many companies as an employee or freelancer, with a very good eye for design and a mind for cost effective and pragmatic solutions. When I started with my web development career, I very quickly noticed I'm not interested in actual programing, but more into being the glue between design and development. That's why I chose frontend as my path. Give me a web design and I translate it into frontend code, without using Bootstrap or Tailwind. I can code custom CSS, and I love it.
